'''
    maze.py

    The main maze library.

    This defines the Player abstract base class and to derived classes - Goody and Baddy.

    It also defines the game-playing classes:
        Maze - a container for holding the layout of a maze (walls and spaces) and for asking questions about
               particular positions in the maze

        Move - a small class whose instances represent the different moves that a player can take
            UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, STAY, 
        Obstruction - a dict-like object, subscriptable by a Move, used to inform a player of their surroundings

        Position - a two-dimensional vector that supports some binary operations, and l1 norm, which might be helpful.

        Game - A class responsible for placing the players within the maze, asking them to take their turn, and
               detecting end-of-game conditions.

    Some utility function for repeatedly playing games, and the helper objects are also defined here:
        STEP, DX, DY, ZERO
